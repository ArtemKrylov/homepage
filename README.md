# homepage

My very own personal website. Basically this is just a résumé.

🤩 Features:

1. Convenient structure - the code (both HTML and CSS) is split into small semantic parts for comfort use and maintenance.
2. Accessibility -
   ⭐ Interactive elements like links have
   ⭐ area-label and rel attributes;
   ⭐ links open in new windows;
   ⭐ Semantic HTML tags
3. Great Appearance
   ⭐ lovely and smooth transitions on hover/focus
   ⭐ Dark mode with cool toggler
   ⭐ eye-catching animations (feel free to hover over the avatar picture 🙃)
