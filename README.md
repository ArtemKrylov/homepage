My very own personal website. Basically this is just a résumé.


🤩 Features:
1. Convenient structure - the code (both html and css) is splitted in small semantic parts for comfort use and maintainance.
2. Accessibility - 
		⭐ interactive elements like links have 
		⭐ arae-label and rel attributes; 
		⭐ links open in new windows; 
		⭐ semantic html tags
